Kali Linux has built into it a tool called "crunch" that enables us to create a custom password-cracking wordlist that we can use with 
such tools like Hashcat, Cain and Abel, John the Ripper, Aircrack-ng, and others.

Syntax:
crunch <min> max<max> <characterset> -t <pattern> -o <output filename>

min = The minimum password length.

max = The maximum password length.

characterset = The character set to be used in generating the passwords.

-t <pattern> = The specified pattern of the generated passwords. For instance, i
  f you knew that the target's birthday was 0728 (July 28th) and you suspected they used their birthday in their password (people often do), 
  you could generate a password list that ended with 0728 by giving crunch the pattern @@@@@@@0728. This word generate passwords up to 
  11 characters (7 variable and 4 fixed) long that all ended with 0728.

-o <outputfile> = This is the file you want your wordlist written to.

-f This switch allows us to choose the character set we want to use to generate our wordlist. The syntax is: -f /path/to/charset.lst
  <charactersetname>
  
/usr/share/rainbowcrack/charset.txt

numeric            = [0123456789]

alpha              = [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]
alpha-numeric      = [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789]

loweralpha         = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]
loweralpha-numeric = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789]

mixalpha           = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]
mixalpha-numeric   = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789]

ascii-32-95                  = [ !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~]
ascii-32-65-123-4            = [ !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`{|}~]
alpha-numeric-symbol32-space = [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_+=~`[]{}|\:;"'<>,.?/ ]

  
  Examples:
  
  crunch 10 10 -t @@@@@@0728 -o /root/birthdaywordlist.lst
  crunch 8 8 -f /usr/share/rainbowcrack/charset.txt mixalpha -o /root/alphawordlist.lst
