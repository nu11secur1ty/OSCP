We use Run when we are calling an external command-line program (or any command that the prompt recognizes). 
It can return %ERRORLEVEL% and with this code, we can show a message to the user saying if the operation was success or not. 
It doesn't support async output, it means that you can't show to the user the output of the external program in real-time, 
you need to wait till the program exits.
