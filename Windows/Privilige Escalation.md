Grab the windows exploits list from here: https://www.securitysift.com/offsec-pwb-oscp/

Then extract all the Windows exploits from this file /usr/share/exploitdb/files.csv

Merge the two lists together to create a Windows exploit list that works for newer operating systems.

Get pre compiled Windows exploits from here and try each one: https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits
